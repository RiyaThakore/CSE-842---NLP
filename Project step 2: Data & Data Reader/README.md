DESCRIPTION

Data: Some of you already have exact dataset in mind; if not, you need to finalize the exact corpus that you are going to use and start exploring it for the second step of the project. In response to this  assignment, give an actual example of your data and send me the statistics about the size, number of training, number of test, and any other information that helps understanding your data. Also send the link to the actual data here. 

Data Reader is a program that reads data items from files (here linguistic corpora) into your machine learning program, and creates training/testing examples. This part of the project is just to make sure that you find your actual data and have a program that can interact with your data: Read the data from a folders/files and have your data items in the form of learning examples. Depending on how clean/structured is your data this step might need a bit of work for you.
